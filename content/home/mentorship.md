## Research Experience for Undergraduates

### Modeling Incidence and Severity of Disease using Healthcare Data

I mentored two undergraduate students in the NSF-sponsored summer REU ["Data and Models in the Biosciences"](https://health.uconn.edu/quantitative-medicine/biomath/). We conducted exploratory and predictive analyses of the [MIMIC-III](https://mimic.physionet.org/) critical care database toward three aims: a triage model of myocardial infarction (MI) patients, a risk assessment model for MI patients, and a time series model of MI occurrence.

I mentored four undergraduate students in the NSF-sponsored summer REU ["Modeling and Simulation in Systems Biology"](https://health.uconn.edu/quantitative-medicine/biomath2017/). We used statistical and network analysis to characterize coauthorship among mathematicians, based on a bibliographic data set from _Mathematical Reviews_ provided by the American Mathematical Society.

## High School Internships

### Ordination in the Tidyverse

I mentored a student through the Achieve internship program at Avon High School. We wrote and documented code to organize and visualize the output of principal components analysis in a pipe-able workflow using tidy data and grammar of graphics principles.

### Formal Context Analysis of Chronic Disease Co-occurrence

I mentored a student through the Achieve internship program at Avon High School. We implemented techniques from formal concept analysis and used them to examine the co-occurrence of chronic diseases in the U.S. population, as recorded in the [National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ahcd/index.htm).

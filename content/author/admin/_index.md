I'm a mathematician and postdoctoral fellow at the [Center for Quantitative Medicine](https://health.uconn.edu/quantitative-medicine/) at [UConn Health](https://health.uconn.edu/), under the supervision of [Reinhard Laubenbacher](http://facultydirectory.uchc.edu/profile?profileId=Laubenbacher-Reinhard). My mathematical training focused on projective geometry and algebraic geometry, and my research background includes scientometry and network science. I'm currently focusing on applications of geometric and topological data analysis to health informatics and outcomes research.
